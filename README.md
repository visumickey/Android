# Android

This repository contains a sample application on Android. This is a simple ToDo application which allows the user with the following options:

1. Enable the user to add new ToDo items
2. Enable the user to delete the items
3. Enable editing of the items

Items are simple "Texts" for now. This will eventually be a fully capable ToDo creator which will more forms of input (image, video and voice).
